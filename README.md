# Contact List API

This project is a REST API for managing a contact list. It is built using FastAPI and SQLAlchemy, and uses PostgreSQL as the database, and Pydantic for data validation. The API supports full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for contacts, as well as search functionality and birthday reminders for the upcoming 7 days.

## Features

- Create new contacts with personal details (name, email, phone, birthday, additional info.)
- Retrieve a list of all contacts
- Search contacts by first name, last name, email, phone number, or additional info
- Update contact information
- Delete contact
- Get a list of contacts with birthdays in the next 7 days

## Requirements

To run the project locally, you will need:

python = "^3.11"
fastapi = "^0.114.2"
uvicorn = "^0.30.6"
psycopg2-binary = "^2.9.9"
sqlalchemy = "^2.0.35"
python-dotenv = "^1.0.1"

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pd-rest-api-contacts.git
cd pd-rest-api-contacts

### 2. Install dependencies

This project uses Poetry to manage dependencies. Install the dependencies by running:

Bash (Copy code)
poetry install

This will create a virtual environment and install all necessary packages as defined in pyproject.toml.

### 3. Set up the PostgreSQL database

You need a running instance of PostgreSQL. Create a database (e.g., contact_list) and configure access credentials in the .env file.

Bash (Copy code)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://your_username:your_password@localhost/contact_list

### 4. Activate the virtual environment

Poetry automatically creates and manages a virtual environment for your project. You can activate it by running:

Bash (Copy code)
poetry shell

Alternatively, you can directly execute commands within the virtual environment by using poetry run, for example:

Bash (Copy code)
poetry run python main.py

### 5. Run the API

To run the FastAPI server locally, use:

Bash (Copy code)
poetry run uvicorn main:app –reload

The API will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000. The interactive API documentation can be found at:
Swagger UI: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
ReDoc: http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc

## Usage

Creating a contact

You can create a new contact by sending a POST request to /contacts/ with the following JSON payload:

Json (Copy code)
{
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "phone_number": "+123456789",
  "birthday": "1990-05-01",
  "additional_info": "Friend from work"
}

Get all contacts: GET /contacts/
Search contacts: GET /contacts/search/?query=John
Get contact by ID: GET /contacts/{contact_id}
Get upcoming birthdays: GET /contacts/birthdays/

Updating a contact

Send a PUT request to /contacts/{contact_id} with the updated data:

Json (Copy code)
{
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe",
  "email": "john.newemail@example.com",
  "phone_number": "+987654321",
  "birthday": "1990-05-01",
  "additional_info": "Updated info"
}

Deleting a contact
Send a DELETE request to /contacts/{contact_id} to remove a contact.
